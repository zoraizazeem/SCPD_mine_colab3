        "- During debugging make sure to run your notebook using the CPU runtime. You can change the notebook runtime by selecting `Runtime` and then `Change runtime type`. From the dropdown, select `None` as the `hardware accelerator`.\n",
        "- When working with PyTorch and Neural Network models, understanding the shapes of different tensors, especially the input and output tensors is incredibly helpful.\n",
        "- When training models, it is helpful to start by only running 1 epoch or even just a couple of batch iterations. This way you can check that all your tensor shapes and logic match up, while also tracking expected behavior, such as a decreasing training loss. Remember to comment out / save the default number of epochs that we provide you.\n"

        "## Creating Your Own Message Passing Layer\n",
        "\n",
        "Now it is time to implement your own message passing layers! Working through this part will help you become acutely familiar with the behind the scenes work of implementing Pytorch Message Passing Layers, allowing you to build you own custom GNN models. In doing so, you will work with and implement 3 critcal functions needed to define a PyG Message Passing Layer: `forward`, `message`, and `aggregate`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before diving head first into the coding details, let us quickly review the key components of the message passing process. First, we focus on a single round of messsage passing with respect to a single node $x$, which we refer to as the central node. The goal of the $lth$ layer of message passing is to update $x$'s feature vector from $x^{l-1}$ to $x^l$. To do so, we implement the following steps: 1) each neighboring node $v$ passes its current message $v^{l-1}$ across the edge $(v, x)$ - 2) for the node $x$, we aggregate all the messages of neighboring nodes (for example through a sum or mean) - and 3) we transform the aggregated information by e.g. applying linear and non-linear transformations. Altogether, the message passing process is applied such that every node $u$ in our graph updates its embedding through acting as the central node $x$ in step 1-3 described above.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's apply this process of propagating and transforming information within the graph to that of coding a single message passing layer. Overall, the general paradigm of message passing layers is: 1) pre-processing -> 2) **message passing** / propagation -> 3) post-processing. The `forward` function that you will implement captures this execution logic. Namely, the `forward` function handles the pre and post-processing of node features / embeddings, as well as initiates message passing by calling the `propagate` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The `propagate` function encapsulates the actual message passing process within the graph! It does so by calling three important functions: 1) `message`, 2) `aggregate`, and 3) `update`. Your implementation will vary slightly from this, as you will not explicitly implement `update`, but instead place the logic for updating node embeddings after message passing and within the `forward` function. To be more specific, after information is propagated (message passing + aggregation), we can further transform the node embeddings outputed by `propagate`. Overall, the output of `forward` is exactly the node embeddings after one GNN layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, before starting to implement our own layer, let us dig a bit deeper into each of the functions described above:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "def propagate(edge_index, x=(x_src, x_dst), extra=(extra_src, extra_dst), size=size):\n",
        "```\n",
        "Calling `propagate` initiates the message passing process. Looking at the function parameters, we highlight a couple of key parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - `edge_index` is passed to the forward function and captures the edge structure of the graph. `edge_index` is of shape - `[2, E]`, where `edge_index[:, e]` represents a single edge $e$ in the graph.\n",
        "  - `x=(x_src, x_dst)` represents the node features that will be used in message passing, where we have the flexibility to distinguish the features of source (src) vs. destination (dst) nodes (e.g. with different transformations). Common notation is to think of the src node features as the node features used for sending messages and dst node features as the central node features that will be receiving these messages. Note, while in this notebook the src and dst matrices will be the same shape - $[N, d]$ (i.e. coming from the same set of nodes), we will see later in the course cases where these nodes can differ.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - `extra=(extra_src, extra_dst)` represents additional information that we can associate with each node beyond its current feature embedding. In fact, we can include as many additional parameters of the form `param=(param_src, param_dst)` as we would like. We highlight that differentiating betwee `_src` and `_dst` allows us to differentiate the features used for central and neighboring node features later in the message passing process.\n",

        "```\n",
        "The `message` function is called by `propagate` and constructs the messages from neighboring nodes (src nodes) to central nodes (dst nodes). Following PyG convention, we subscript variables dealing with src nodes with `_j` and dst nodes  with `_i`.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - `x_j` represents the matrix of node features for *each src node of each edge* in the graph. Specifically, messages are constructed along each edge $(j, i) \\in E$, where edge_index is used extract node feature information to construct `x_j` as `x_j = x_src[edge_index[0, :], :]`. Thus, `x_j` has shape $[|E|, d]$!\n",
        "\n",
        "  - `...` represent any additional arguments passed to `propagate`, from which we can differentiate between src and dst node types by appending `_i` or `_j` to the variable name. In implementing GAT you will see how you can leverage accessing additional variables passed to propagate.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Critically, we emphasize that the output of the `message` function is a matrix of messages ready to be aggregated, having shape $[|E|, d]$, where these messages are constructed by applying different potential transformations to the initial src node embedding messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Note** Understanding the message passing process is definitely a confusing concept; however, it is very helpful to think of the `message` function acting on each individual edges in the graph (i.e. producing a message for each directed edge $(j, i)$). Moreover, for undirected graphs since we store both directions of each edge, each node $u$ acts both as a src and dst node, sending messages to its neighbors and then also aggregating messages from its same set of neighbors.\n",

DeepSNAP thus greatly saves in coding efforts and enables fair model comparison.\n",
